	<h1>Name: Denise Shirely</h1>
	 <p>My name is Denise. I am majoring in CIS.  I waited 20 yrs to come back to school.  Better late than never, right?</p>
	 <p>I have 8 kids, no twins or triplets. I love my family.  I love to ride horses and I love working with computers.</p> 
	 <p>I am hoping to one day be able to make a difference in this world. </p>
